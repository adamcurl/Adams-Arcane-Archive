            <h3>Cleaving</h3>
            <p>When a melee attack reduces an undamaged creature to 0 hit points, any excess damage from that attack might carry over to another creature nearby. The attacker targets another creature within reach and, if the original attack roll can hit it, applies any remaining damage to it. You may repeat this process if the second creature is reduced to 0. Carryover the remaining damage to the next one.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="subsection">
            <h3>Climbing onto a creature</h3>
            <p>A player can use an action to make an Athletics or Acrobatics check contested by the creature's Acrobatics check to climb onto a larger creature. The smaller creature moves with the larger creature, and the larger creature can use an action (or other situations) to shake the smaller creature off by using Athletics contested by the smaller creature's Athletics or Acrobatics.</p>
            <p>The smaller creature has advantage on attacks against the larger creature but makes any Dexterity or Strength saving throws from the larger creature at disadvantage. The smaller creature treats the larger creature's body as difficult terrain and must have at least one free hand to stay latched on.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="subsection">
            <h3>Critical Hits</h3>
            <p>When you get a critical hit, double the value of all damage dice rolled.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="subsection">
            <h3>Flanking</h3>
            <p>Flanking only works if the creature being flanked is at max 1 size larger than the creatures flanking.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="subsection">
            <h3>Lingering Injuries</h3>
            <p>A creature might incur a lingering injury from the following situations:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Take more than half your hit points in damage from a single source of damage.</li>
                <li>When it drops to 0 hit points, but isn't killed outright.</li>
                <li>When it fails a death saving throw by 5 or more.</li>

            <p>For resurrection spells that take longer than an action to cast, the DM will roll a resurrection check (DC 10).

Each time a character is brought back to life, the resurrection DC permanently increases by 1, making it harder to constantly revive players.</p>
